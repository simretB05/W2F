    <p>
      I always wanted to know how websites come to life, so I decided to attend
      InnoTech, an IT college, to learn full-stack web development.I devoted
      myself to mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
      The curriculum was intensive but fulfilling, with a hands-on approach and
      project-based learning that made it both fun and challenging.
